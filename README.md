# Hi, I'm Spencer — aka Aelius23

Founder-brained, system-whispering creative technologist.  
I design tools, pipelines, and UI that feel like signal in the noise.

- **AI-powered video tools** (After Effects plugin, lip sync pipeline, Matrix media scrapers)
- **Signal processing & data viz** for scientific + narrative systems
- **Experimental interfaces** for mystical UX + creator infrastructure

### 🛰️ Looking to:
Support a founder or research team that needs:
- Calm, high-context ops support  
- Storytelling through systems  
- Someone who can design the interface *and* the underlying logic
